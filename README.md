<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

PixArt is a simple Pixel Art creator with 2 types of games: ColorBook and Mirror.

In the first one you have to color the pixels with the color associated with the number on them in a specified amount of time that you choose before the starting of the game.

In order to play the second one you need to complete the ColorBook game before. This game consists of copying exactly the image that you paint before with the help of Mr.Incredible who will judge your abilities with his expressions.
